## Todo App using React Typescript
### Context, ContextProvider, useReducer

In this exercise I am learning on how to build a robust Todo application using React and taking advantage of the superset Typescript.

The app uses Context useReducer to manage state in the application.

This exercise was brought by <a>Fernando Herrera</a> a great mentor focus on CleanCode, Solid Principles and best practices.
